Kafka Multi Cluster Setup (Note: Intitial individual kafka setup should be run first)

The next few steps must be done for every computer you plan to use.

1.Give each computer a number sequentially from 0 to the total amount of machines you plan to use
(This number gets used at multipe steps later on so I figured its easiest to decide it now)

2.Find the private IP address for each machine
On linux its probably easisest to just use "hostname -I" in the command line

3.Make aliases for the private IP address of each machine in /etc/hosts
(For whatever reason, in the configuration file runs into problems if you give it the address directly.  Its also more convenient when making topics and producing or consuming from them later on)

Should end up looking the same on every computer.  For the test instance mine was:
192.168.0.128   Kafka0
192.168.0.100   Kafka1
192.168.0.129   Kafka2


4. create a directory called "zookeeperLogs" in the kafka directory

5. Edit the zookeeper.properties file in Kafka/config
Note: This only needs to be done once, all computers can have the exact same zookeeper config file. I find it easier to go through this process with a base file and change it as needed.
(An example configuration can be found on the kafka-migration github)

The different values are:
dataDir

dataDir points to where the zookeeper logs are kept (the zookeeper myid is also kept here, which will be touched on in the next step). I prefer to have it point to the zookeeperLogs directory made in the previous step, to keep things together. For example, mine ended up being:

dataDir=/home/noahbrumfield/Desktop/Kafka/zookeeperLogs

maxClientCnxns

the value of maxClientCnxns determines how many connections zookeeper will  take from one host.  This is to prevent one one host from taking all the resources from one zookeeper server, and thus preventing other machines from connecting.  (Its a little hard to tell how this number needs to be tweaked without the full implemantion running, so this number will probaby go through some changes) for now I have it set at:

maxClientCnxns = 200

server.0 through server.TOTALNUM

for every machine you plan to have in use, there needs to be a value

server.# = private IP Address

where # is the number you decided in step one, with that machines corresponding private IP address

ticktime

The length of a single tick, the basic time unit for zookeeper. Measured in milliseconds.  Used to determine time for timeouts and the like. Currently set at:

ticktime = 2000

initLimit

amount of time given for zookeepers followers to connect and sync to the leader for the first time.  If the amount of data is large, then this number may need to be increased. Currently set at:

initLimit = 20

syncLimit

syncLimit is similar to initLimit, but it is the amount of time given to followers to sync when they have already established a connection with the leader.  If these followers fall behind, they will be dropped and the other zookeeper instances will keep going without it. Currently set at:

synLimit = 10
